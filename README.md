<h3>Día de Reyes</h3>

January 06, 2022


On January 6th, Puerto Rico celebrates el Día de Reyes (Three Kings Day) or Epiphany, which commemorates the visit that the Three Wise Men paid to Jesus after his birth. While the entire island celebrates this holiday, the most renown festivities are held in the southern town of Juana Díaz. For over 135 years, the town of Juana Díaz has celebrated this holiday with a festival and parade that gathers over 25,000 people. The main attraction during the festivities are the Three Kings riding on horseback, which are depicted by actors wearing colorful robes and thick beards.
